# Amend Commit

Amending a commit can be used in two scenarios: adding or updating files in the last commit, or simply updating the last
commit message. However, amending only works on the most recent commit, not on commits further back in history.

- `git add <new_files_or_changes>`
- `git commit --amend` - opens default editor to update the last commit message
