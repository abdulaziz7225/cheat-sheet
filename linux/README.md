1. **List all manually installed packages** (this includes packages that were explicitly installed):

2. **Check what a package depends on** before removing it:

   ```bash
   apt depends <package-name>
   ```

3. **Remove a specific package** (e.g., an unused text editor):

   ```bash

   ```

   or if you want to remove configuration files too:

   ```bash
   sudo apt purge <package-name>
   ```
